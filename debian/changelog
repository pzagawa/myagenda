myagenda (1.2-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * Only single application instance allowed.
    Useful if you run MyAgenda at startup. Another execution brings main
    window to top (or sets its icon urgency), returns message and custom
    exit code EX_INSTANCE_RUNNING=1

  * Launcher quicklist added. New menu items:
    - “New Note” - opens dialog directly with current date.
    - “Show Note: “...”” - shows newest note edit dialog.
    - “Clear Reminder: “...”” - clears newest reminder.
